# Notes Log
_Usage guidelines live in AGENTS.md section 6._

[2025/10/04 12:20:23] [AI] > Brought the repo layout and tooling in line with contributor docs: moved LLM sources under `src/llm`, added placeholder READMEs for `kernel/`, `ctx/`, `infra/`, `tests/`, refreshed build scripts and README paths, introduced a dependency-free YAML parser in `src/ctx/library/`, expanded `tests/run_tests.sh` to cover both `gemma_cli` and the new parser, documented testing obligations in `AGENTS.md`, and set up GitHub Actions plus local instructions so contributors have a clear, enforceable workflow.
[2025/10/04 12:23:12] [AI] > Linked NOTES.md usage requirements into AGENTS.md ยง6 and trimmed the notes file intro so instructions live in one place; added reminder that NOTES entries are mandatory and updated the ledger accordingly.

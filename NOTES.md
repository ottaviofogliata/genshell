# Notes Log
_Usage guidelines live in AGENTS.md section 6._ \
_Newest log at the top of the file._

[2025-10-05 19:33:09] > Added a MkDocs + Material documentation site (docs/ + mkdocs.yml), ported existing README and contributor guidance into structured pages, introduced a Doxygen config that outputs to docs/api for API reference, and documented the new workflow in README.md.

[2025-10-04 20:35:00] > Promoted the POSIX shell toolchain by rewriting build scripts (mac/pc) to default to genshell, adding optional llm targets, refreshing the complete helpers, and overhauled README.md to describe the new shell-first workflow, known gaps, and opt-in LLM steps.

[2025-10-04 20:12:34] > Landed the first genshell implementation: scaffolded the kernel shell runtime with REPL, lexer/parser, executor, and a strategy-builtins registry, split builtins into dedicated files (cd, exit, pwd, echo, export, unset, umask), and produced the `bin/genshell` binary; background jobs and advanced redirection remain TODO, and clang-format is missing locally so formatting should be run once available.

[2025-10-04 12:23:12] > Linked NOTES.md usage requirements into AGENTS.md ยง6 and trimmed the notes file intro so instructions live in one place; added reminder that NOTES entries are mandatory and updated the ledger accordingly.

[2025-10-04 12:20:23] > Brought the repo layout and tooling in line with contributor docs: moved LLM sources under `src/llm`, added placeholder READMEs for `kernel/`, `ctx/`, `infra/`, `tests/`, refreshed build scripts and README paths, introduced a dependency-free YAML parser in `src/ctx/library/`, expanded `tests/run_tests.sh` to cover both `gemma_cli` and the new parser, documented testing obligations in `AGENTS.md`, and set up GitHub Actions plus local instructions so contributors have a clear, enforceable workflow.

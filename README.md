# GenShell

GenShell is a ground-up POSIX-style shell written in C with an optional local LLM sidecar powered by llama.cpp. The primary goal today is correctness and safety in the traditional REPL path; model-assisted workflows remain strictly opt-in and live behind a narrow shim.

## 1. Prerequisites
- Clang or GCC with C17 support (Clang is used in all helper scripts).
- `cmake` if you plan to build the bundled `llama.cpp` extras.
- macOS (arm64, Metal) or Linux (x86_64/arm64) – the shell itself is portable, the LLM path requires platform-specific acceleration flags.
- Optional: Python 3.9+ and `pip` for GGUF conversion utilities, `git` for fetching model weights.

After cloning make sure the llama.cpp submodule is available when you need the LLM pieces:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## 2. Building the Shell (default)
The platform helpers now prioritise the shell executable. By default they compile `bin/genshell`; pass extra targets when you need the LLM demo.

- **macOS / Unix-like:**
  ```bash
  ./build_mac.sh          # builds bin/genshell
  ./build_mac.sh all      # builds shell + bin/gemma_cli (expects llama.cpp static libs)
  ```
- **Linux / Windows (MSYS/WSL):**
  ```bash
  ./build_pc.sh           # builds bin/genshell
  ./build_pc.sh all       # builds shell + bin/gemma_cli (expects llama.cpp static libs)
  ```

The scripts respect `CC`, `CXX`, `SHELL_CFLAGS`, `LLM_CFLAGS`, and `LLM_CXXFLAGS` if you need to override toolchains or warning levels. Object files land in `build/obj/`, and artefacts in `bin/`.

To build the llama.cpp static libraries first, use the `*_complete` helpers which run CMake for you and then invoke the corresponding build script with the `all` target:

```bash
./build_mac_complete.sh   # macOS Metal toolchain + both binaries
./build_pc_complete.sh    # CPU-only toolchain + both binaries
```

## 3. Running GenShell
Launch the shell directly once `bin/genshell` exists:

```bash
./bin/genshell
```

Current capabilities include:
- Strategy-dispatched builtins (`cd`, `exit`, `pwd`, `echo`, `export`, `unset`, `umask`) held in separate translation units with documentation headers.
- External command execution with `PATH` lookup, pipes, simple redirections, and environment/tilde expansion.

Known gaps for this milestone:
- Background jobs and job control are not implemented (pipelines always run in the foreground).
- Only basic redirection operators are supported; descriptors such as `2>&1` and here-documents are TODO.
- Word splitting, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and shell functions are not yet available.

## 4. Repository Layout
```
include/                   # Public headers shared across subsystems
src/
  kernel/
    shell/                 # REPL, parser, executor, builtins
  ctx/                     # Context collectors and YAML helpers
  infra/                   # Low-level OS plumbing (placeholders)
  llm/                     # llama.cpp shim and demo CLI
bin/                       # Build artefacts (genshell, gemma_cli, ...)
models/                    # GGUF checkpoints (ignored by git)
tests/                     # Manual smoke tests and harness stubs
```

## 5. Optional LLM Sidecar
The llama.cpp-based helper (`bin/gemma_cli`) remains available for experimentation. After building the static libs (see §2) you can run:

```bash
./bin/gemma_cli models/<model>.gguf "List a few automation tasks."
```

Preparing Gemma checkpoints follows the standard llama.cpp workflow:
1. Install Python requirements inside `deps/llama.cpp` (`python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Download weights with `huggingface_hub` or your preferred tooling.
3. Convert to GGUF via `convert_hf_to_gguf.py` and optionally quantise with `llama-quantize`.

These steps mirror the upstream documentation; adjust paths or quantisation levels to fit your hardware.

## 6. Development Notes
- Keep each builtin in its own `src/kernel/shell/builtins/<name>.c` file with a descriptive comment explaining behaviour and edge cases.
- Functions return `0` on success and negative values for internal errors (`gs_shell.h` lists the common constants). Propagate `errno` semantics where practical.
- Run `clang-format` on touched sources before committing (the binary may not be installed on all hosts—install it when possible and reformat touched files).
- Log meaningful repository changes in `NOTES.md` using the timestamped format described in the contributor guide.

## 7. Tests & Verification
Structured tests are still minimal. Run the smoke tests from the repo root:

```bash
./tests/run_tests.sh
```

Until automated coverage lands, manually exercise the shell on macOS and Linux before merging significant changes.

## 8. Documentation
- Narrative documentation lives under `docs/` and is served with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) using the Material theme.
- API reference is generated by Doxygen into `docs/api/` and linked into the MkDocs navigation.

Install MkDocs:

```bash
python3 -m pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin pymdown-extensions
```

Install Doxygen:

- macOS (Homebrew): `brew install doxygen && brew install graphviz`
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y doxygen graphviz`
- Fedora: `sudo dnf install doxygen graphviz`
- Arch: `sudo pacman -S doxygen graphviz`
- Windows (choco): `choco install doxygen.install graphviz`
- Windows (scoop): `scoop install doxygen graphviz`

Graphviz (`dot`) is required for Doxygen call/class diagrams; install it alongside Doxygen to enable those assets in the generated docs.

**Generate C API docs and start mkdocs server**.

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile && mkdocs serve
```

The static site will include the generated `docs/api/html/index.html` automatically when you run `mkdocs build` or `mkdocs serve`.

### CI: Auto-build and publish docs
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds Doxygen + MkDocs and publishes to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`:

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/docs.yml`
- Output: the compiled MkDocs site in `site/` is deployed via Pages. The Doxygen HTML under `docs/api/html/` is included in the site build and linked from the nav.

Enable Pages in your repo settings:
- Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: GitHub Actions.

Manual run: use the "Run workflow" button under the Actions tab to trigger a rebuild.

## 9. When the Repository Goes Public (Release Checklist)
Use this checklist the moment GenShell is published and you cut a release. These steps ensure docs, binaries, and process are ready for external contributors.

- Governance & Safety
  - Enable branch protection on `main` (require PRs + status checks).
  - Add `SECURITY.md` with vulnerability disclosure instructions (optional but recommended).
  - Confirm `LICENSE` is correct and present at repo root.

- Submodules & Assets
  - Verify `deps/llama.cpp` is a clean submodule (no local diffs).
  - Ensure `models/` is `.gitignore`d and contains no weights.

- Documentation
  - Run `doxygen Doxyfile` to refresh `docs/api/html/`.
  - `python3 -m pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin pymdown-extensions`.
  - `mkdocs build` and sanity‑check site output in `site/`.
  - Enable GitHub Pages: Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions.
  - Verify the workflow `.github/workflows/docs.yml` runs on push to `main` and publishes the site.

- Release Artifacts
  - Build binaries: `./build_mac.sh` (macOS) and `./build_pc.sh` (Linux/WSL). Optionally `*_complete.sh` to include LLM helper.
  - Smoke test: `./bin/genshell` and, if built, `./bin/gemma_cli models/<model>.gguf "hello"`.
  - Tag and create a GitHub Release (e.g., `v0.1.0`), attach built artifacts from `bin/`.

- Issues & Community
  - Turn on Issues and Discussions in repo settings.
  - Add basic issue templates for bug/feature (optional: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`).

- Optional Versioned Docs (later)
  - If/when needed, add mike versioning:
    - `pip install mike`
    - In `mkdocs.yml` set `extra.version.provider: mike` and `default: latest`.
    - First deploy: `mike deploy 0.1 latest && mike set-default latest` (requires Pages from `gh-pages` branch).

- Notes & Traceability
  - Add a `NOTES.md` entry summarizing the publication and initial release notes.
  - Ensure `AGENTS.md` remains truthful about build, layout, and processes.

# C API Reference

Run Doxygen from the repository root to build the latest HTML reference:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

The generated files land in `docs/api/html/`. Open `docs/api/html/index.html` locally or serve the documentation with MkDocs (`mkdocs serve`).

Once generated, you can view the rendered API documentation [here](html/index.html).

> **Tip:** Install Graphviz so Doxygen can emit call graphs, collaboration diagrams, and other `dot`-powered visuals. Without it the corresponding sections will be skipped.

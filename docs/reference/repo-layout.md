## Key Components
- `src/kernel/shell/`: The interactive shell. Lexer/parser, executor, builtin registry and strategy implementations live here.
- `src/llm/`: llama.cpp integration, Qwen-first inference helpers (legacy Gemma still supported), and CLI glue.
- `src/ctx/`: Context collection utilities and lightweight YAML helpers for future configuration work.
- `tests/`: Smoke-test scripts and harness stubs. Extend with unit tests as infrastructure lands.
- `bin/`: Build outputs (`genshell`, `gemma_cli` sidecar, supporting tools).
- `build/`: Intermediate objects and logs generated by helper scripts.
- `include/`: Shared headers documenting ownership and cross-module interfaces.

## Directory Conventions
- Keep llama.cpp as an unmodified submodule under `deps/llama.cpp`.
- Place GGUF checkpoints in `models/` so they stay out of version control.
- Add new subsystems under `src/` with README files summarising intent once implementations grow.
